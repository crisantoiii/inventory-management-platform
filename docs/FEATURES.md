## Overview

The Inventory Management Platform is a modern ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application built using Clean Architecture principles. It currently provides reusable infrastructure for Product, Category, and Supplier management through consistent CRUD operations, server-side searching, sorting, filtering, and pagination. The architecture is designed to support additional inventory modules with minimal duplication.
