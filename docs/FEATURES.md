# Features

## Overview

The Inventory Management Platform is a modern ASP.NET Core 10 Razor Pages application built using Clean Architecture principles.

The platform currently provides business modules for:

- Product
- Category
- Supplier
- Customer
- Unit
- Inventory Transactions
- Purchasing
- Dashboard Reporting
- Authentication
- User Management

Shared infrastructure such as paging, filtering, sorting, the Result pattern, and Identity service abstractions are reused consistently across modules while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

# Architecture Validation

The project completed **Architecture Sprint 1** after implementing the foundational modules.

The review validated:

- Application Layer
- Infrastructure Layer
- Web Layer
- Shared Infrastructure
- Engineering Documentation

Outcome:

- ✅ Architecture validated
- ✅ No structural redesign required
- ✅ Ready for workflow-driven business modules

The next milestone is **v1.1.0 Purchasing Presentation Layer**.
